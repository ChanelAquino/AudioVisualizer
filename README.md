#Multimedia Programming: Audio Visualization

##TEAM MEMBERS 
	1. Chanel Aquino (github.com/ChanelAquino)
	2. Matt Wall (github.com/CSUMBmWall)
	3. Samba Diallo (github.com/SambaDialloB)

##OBJECTIVE 
Our group intends to utilize Python libraries to build a program that takes in an audio/sound file, analyzes its characteristics (e.g., pitch, beat, frequency, etc.), and creates a visually appealing representation of variations in sound. If time permits, we will create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow the user to navigate through a menu of options.

##PHASES
1.  Research Python Libraries
  1.  scipy: to read in sound files
  2.  numpy: to manipulate/analyze sound data
  3.  matplotlib: to execute data visualization processes
  4.  Tkinter: to implement GUI
    * Other libraries used are in libraries.py

2.  Development
  1.  Read in sound file.
    * Programmer-define .wav file
  2.  Analyze various data from sound file.
    * Signal Wave
    * Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
    * Hanning Window
    * Magnitude Values
  3.  Visualize the data.
    * matplotlib

3.  Testing/Future Improvements
  1.  Experiment with different audio files (i.e., hard-coded sound file versus user-defined sound file)
  2.  Experiment with different data visualization options (e.g., matplotlib, Bokeh)
  3.  Test different user inputs (e.g., choose from different visualization effects)
  4.  Improve GUI using proper design schematics (font, color schemes, layout, etc.)
  5.  Implement more functionality (i.e., different ways to analyze sound)
