#Multimedia Programming: Audio Visualization

##TEAM MEMBERS 
	1. Chanel Aquino (github.com/ChanelAquino)
	2. Matt Wall (github.com/CSUMBmWall)
	3. Samba Diallo (github.com/SambaDialloB)

##OBJECTIVE 
Our group intends to utilize Python libraries to build a program that takes in an audio/sound files, analyzes its characteristics (e.g., pitch, beat, frequency, etc.), and creates a visually appealing representation of variations in sound. If time permits, we will create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow the user to navigate through a menu of options.

##PHASES
1.  Research Python Libraries
  1.  scipy: to read in sound files
  2.  numpy: to manipulate/analyze sound data
  3.  matplotlib: to execute data visualization processes
  4.  Tkinter: to implement GUI

2.  Development
  1.  Read in sound file.
    * Hard-code versus user-defined
  2.  Analyze various data from sound file.
    * Signal Wave
    * Audio with Hanning Window
    * Magnintude Values
    * Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
  3.  Visualize the data.
    * matplotlib

3.  Testing
  1.  Experiment with different audio files (i.e., hard-coded sound file versus user-defined sound file)
  2.  Experiment with different data visualization options (e.g., matplotlib, Bokeh)
  3.  Test different user inputs (e.g., choose from different visualization effects)
